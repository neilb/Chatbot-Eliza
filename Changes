      Thanks Mats!

1.01 2003-01-17
    - Added an empty DESTORY method, to eliminate some pesky warning messages.
      Suggested by Stas Bekman.

0.97 1999-10-31
    - One tiny change to the regex which implements reassemble rules.
      Thanks to Gidon Wise for suggesting this improvement.

0.95 1999-07-09
    - Fixed a bug in the way the bot invokes its random function
      when it pulls a comment out of memory.

0.93 1999-06-04
    - Calling programs can now specify their own random-number generators.
      Use this syntax:
            $chatbot = new Chatbot::Eliza;
            $chatbot->myrand( sub { #function goes here!  } );
      The custom random function should have the same prototype
      as perl's built-in rand() function.  That is, it should take
      a single (numeric) expression as a parameter, and it should
      return a floating-point value between 0 and that number.
    - You can also now use a reference to an anonymous hash
      as a parameter to the new() method to define any fields
      in that bot instance:
            $bot = new Chatbot::Eliza {
                name       => "Brian",
                scriptfile => "myscript.txt",
                debug      => 1,
            };

0.91 1999-04-08
    - Fixed some misspellings.
    - Fixed a bug in the way individual bot objects store their memory.
      Thanks to Randal Schwartz and to Robert Chin for pointing this out.
    - Fixed a very stupid error in the way the random function is invoked.
      Thanks to Antony Quintal for pointing out the error.
    - Many corrections and improvements were made to the German script
      by Matthias Hellmund.  Thanks, Matthias!
    - Made a minor syntactical change, at the suggestion of Roy Stephan.
    - The memory functionality can now be disabled by setting the
      $Chatbot::Eliza::memory_on variable to 0, like so:
                $bot->memory_on(0);
      Thanks to Robert Chin for suggesting that.

0.40 1998-07-25
    - Re-implemented the memory functionality.
    - Cleaned up and expanded the embedded POD documentation.
    - Added a sample script in German.
    - Modified the debugging behavior.  The transform() method itself
      will no longer print any debugging output directly to STDOUT.
      Instead, all debugging output is stored in a module variable
      called "debug_text".  The "debug_text" variable is printed out
      by the command_interface() method, if the debug flag is set.
      But even if this flag is not set, the variable debug_text
      is still available to any calling program.
    - Added a few more example scripts which use the module.
            simple       - simple script using Eliza.pm
            simple.cgi   - simple CGI script using Eliza.pm
            debug.cgi    - CGI script which displays debugging output
            deutsch      - script using the German script
            deutsch.cgi  - CGI script using the German script
            twobots      - script which creates two distinct bots

0.32 1997-12-13
    - Fixed a bug in the way Eliza loads its default internal script data.
      (Thanks to Randal Schwartz for pointing this out.)
    - Removed the "memory" functions internal to Eliza.
      When I get them working properly I will add them back in.
    - Added one more example program.
    - Fixed some minor errors in the embedded POD documentation.

0.31 1997-12-06
    - First release to CPAN
